Note: The ['offical' emonTx firmware](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx3) and [emonTx 3-phase firmware](https://https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx-3phase/) now support emonESP 

i.e outputs serial data in a format and baud rate that the [EmonESP](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonesp) expects. 

**Using the offical firmware is recomended where possible**

*This development emonesp specific firmware will not longer be supported*
