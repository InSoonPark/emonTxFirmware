Note: The [standard emonTx firmware](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx3) and [emonTx 3-phase firmware](https://https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx-3phase/) now outputs serial data in a format and baud rate that the [EmonESP](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonesp) expects. Using the standard firmware over this firmware is recomended where possible
